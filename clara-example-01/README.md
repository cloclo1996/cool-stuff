# README for both of Clara's examples
The purpose of the two examples I have done in this project have been to explore the PixiJS library and understand an API. clara-example-01 is not extended, it is only an attempt at re-creating the 'Container' example that you can find here: https://pixijs.io/examples/#/demos-basic/container.js

clara-example-02 is extended and explained in the README specific to that example.
