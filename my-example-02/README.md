# Example 2

This is an experiment with Texture Mesh - Basic done by My Mikkelsen Sj√∂holm

In this example I re-wrote the necessary code to get three "worms" and repositioned them by changing the X- and Y values. I changed the length/thickness of them and also the way the waves behaved. This kind of movement can be used in loading screens och when a request is pending. It can also be used for animated graphic content on digital platforms.
