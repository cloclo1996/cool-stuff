This project has been about exploring PixiJS and more specifically how to use movement and velocity with PixiJS.

We wanted to see how we could use movement and velocity as a prototyping tool. We came up with these examples, which can be tested in various ways to see how movement and velocity would change the parameters of an artifact. 

When extending these examples we were thinking of testing these in a “loading screen” environment, or when a request is pending. This is to see how the users behaviour towards a loading screen might or might not change with interactive movement on the screen.

This project is useful for prototyping purposes.
