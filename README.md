This project has been about exploring PixiJS and more specifically how to use movement and velocity with PixiJS.

We wanted to see how we could use movement and velocity as a prototyping tool. We came up with these examples, which can be tested in various ways to see how movement and velocity would change the parameters of an artifact. 

When extending these examples we were thinking of testing these in a “loading screen” environment, or when a request is pending. This is to see how the users behaviour towards a loading screen might or might not change with interactive movement on the screen.

This project is useful for prototyping purposes.

•	A general README.md Explaining the project:
The purpose of this project was to explore an API library. What can be done with it and what can we as interaction designers use it for. At the end we were to present this to the class and talk about our findings.

# General README

## How to get going
1. You need a webserver in your root project to to use PIXI. The best way is to run Node and Github.

2. Create a folder for your project and launch a webserver in the project's root directory.

3. Install Pixi.

    <a id='installingpixi'></a>

4. Find the file named 'pixi.min.js' in this respository (https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases/tag/v4.5.5)

5. Create a basic HTML page and put something like this in it: 
    <script src="pixi.min.js"></script>

If pixi is linked correctly something similar to this will be shown in the console of the browser:

    PixiJS 4.4.5 - * canvas * http://www.pixijs.com/  ♥♥♥ 

6. You have to create a Pixi application by writing this in your code:

    <a id='application'></a>
